# orbtk-popup

Modified OrbTk popup widget (so have the same licence).
This popup is presented using the overlay layer, so it will float over other content.
It is possible to set as target an entity or a point, so can be placed everywhere.
Lastly it have a `relative_position` property that select the position relative to the target.
The relative position could be Top,Bottom,Left,Right.
In future, a radiant based implementation could be used, so the user could place the popup everywhere he want.
